This is a minimalist music and colour combinations generator. It creates melodies and shifting loops and associates them with colours.

Inspired by 60s minimalist music experiments like Steve Reich's. And by Cruz Novillo's [Opus 14](http://www.cruznovilloopus14.com/opus14.php) piece. And it's dedicated to my friends Mariajo and David and the lovely eve that inspired this project.

## Ada mode

The first mode implemented. It selects a random major scale, it randomises the notes of the scale. Then it starts cycles of shifting loops. Each cycle drops one note of the scale in loop B and loops all the possible patterns with the original loop A. When all the patterns are complete, a new scale is randomised and the process starts again. Each note is associated with a colour that shows on the screen while it plays. All this produces a large number of random notes, some are repeating some are changing. The interesting theory behind minimalist music is that these patterns start to create other patterns in the brain of the listener that aren't even there. 

Then there is the natural latency between the loops that can start to pull them apart producing another set of totally unplanned and delicious results.
